UART to Half Duplex TTL / RS485 Converter
# IR-UART01

- The IR-UART01 is a UART to Half Duplex TTL (or RS-485) converter that can control the mightyZAP linear actuator through Half Duplex TTL or RS-485 communication using UART signals in an embedded (user board) environment.
- DC 3.3V for communication and motor input power must be applied separately through the power terminal according to the input voltage of the purchased mightyZAP actuator.
- Various parameter settings, operation tests are available according to the Command Packet. Please refer to the actuator user manual for more detailed info.
- Allowable current: 3A / Voltage supply : 7.4V or 12V or 24V
