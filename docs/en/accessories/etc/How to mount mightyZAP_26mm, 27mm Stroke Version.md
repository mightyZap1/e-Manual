# How to mount mightyZAP_26mm, 27mm Stroke Version
## Option#1 : Using End bearing(IR-EB01)
This method can be used to secure both sides of servo motor using End bearing. 
In this case, mechanical condition should permit servo motor movement by using spring or LM Guide. (<font color="#ff0000">In case of spring connection</font>, tension should be within the range of rated force to prevent overload.)

> [!warning] Caution
> - Make sure to fix the end bearings by paying attention to the order of the washer as shown in the picture above. 
> - Failure to tighten in order may cause malfunction or product damage.
## 2. Option#2 : Using <font color="#ff0000">Lateral Mounting</font> Metal Barcket(IR-MB02) (IR-MB02 which is dedicated for 26mm, 27mm stroke version <font color="#ff0000">Lateral mounting</font>)
This is the most common method to mount mightyZAP. 
Fix mightyZAP using dedicated metal bracket IR-MB02.
1) **Separate the metal brackets from the top and bottom as shown in the figure below.** mightyZAP can be mounted by IR-MB02 without directivity.

2. **Make sure to put spring washer before M2.5 L5 screw is applied.**
   (See Red circle on image #② below.) <font color="#ff0000">Otherwise, it may damage the servo motor inside. </font>Tighten the metal bracket with <font color="#ff0000">4pcs of</font> M2 L2 screw.

## 3. Option#3 : Using Vertical Mounting Metal Barcket(IR-MB04) (IR-MB04 which is dedicated for 26mm, 27mm stroke version Vertical mounting)
1. **Separate the metal brackets from the top and bottom as shown in the figure below.**
   As shown in the figure below, pay attention to the direction of the actuator for proper mounting.![[2627mm_stroke_ass_6.png]]
2. **Make sure to put spring washer before M2.5 L5 screw is applied.**
   (See Red circle on image below.) <font color="#ff0000">Otherwise, it may damage the servo motor inside.</font>
   Then, tighten the metal brackets with<font color="#ff0000"> 2pcs of</font> M2 L4 screw.
