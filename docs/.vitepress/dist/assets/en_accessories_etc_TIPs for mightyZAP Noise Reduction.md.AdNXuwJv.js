Therefore, some mechanical noise is inevitable, but you can reduce the noise by changing the installation method or changing some parameter condition.</p><p>Noise is an absolute loudness (db), and mightyZAP’s noise is about 50db at 1m distance. But, when we consider there are also emotional noises that people feel depending on the frequency level of noise (absolute noise is not so loud, but emotional noise is different case).</p><p>Through the following methods, user may control absolute sound level as well as emotional sound.</p><h2 id="_1-changing-mounting-method" tabindex="-1">1) Changing mounting method <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-changing-mounting-method" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1) Changing mounting method&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When installing actuator, minimize the area of contact with the mounting surface and use some shock absorbing material such as rubber pads, silicone pads, leather or sponge pads that can absorb vibrations and sound between actuator and mounting surface to reduce noise.</p><p>In addition, in some cases, check if actuator is mounted on a sound box structure, and consider how to fill the inside with sound absorbing material or to separate an actuator from the sound box structure.</p><h2 id="_2-decreasing-input-voltage" tabindex="-1">2.
